             the lock. If they were, the app would deadlock, because in the middle of
             calling the `didChangeValueForKey()` method, the observers try to access
             properties like "isReady" or "isFinished". Since those methods also
             acquire the lock, then we'd be stuck waiting on our own lock. It's the
             classic definition of deadlock.
